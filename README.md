# Full Stack Coding Challenge

Help! Through an unfortunate accident in our lab, we've lost all of the code. We need your help to rebuild from scratch as quickly as possible!

The client app and the backend are written entirely in Typescript, using React in the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We've built an MVP template, but need your help implementing one of the most requested features - _Contract Discounts_

Please spend only up to two hours implementing the frontend and backend for the contract discount feature. **Important** — when you're done:

- Remove the `node_modules` folder
- Remove `dist folder` from server folder
- Zip up this directory
- Edit the last section of this README file with a short blurb telling us what tradeoffs you made (if any) and how you might improve your solution and any other outstanding thoughts.
- Submit it back to us

## Task details

- Users should be able to see all of their contracts in a table format with key information called out in the columns
- On contract click users should be brought to a modal that shows them specific contract details
- Within this modal will live a magic button, when clicked \$500 gets immediately shaved off of the contract ( That is the magical experience! )
- This magical experience is not complete unless both frontend and backend are updated.
- For the simplicity of this exercise we are only using an in memory object on the backend where we would normally be using a DB.

## Running locally

- `npm i` — Installs dependencies
- `npm start:frontend` — Starts the frontend code
- `npm start:server` — Starts the server

You can run each of these commands in different terminals

## Tradeoffs and follow-ups
